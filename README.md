# Scroller for Obsidian

I created Scroller to fix a few practical issues I had while writing in Obsidian. The plugin adds a typewriter mode to keep the active line centred, a focus mode to dim distractions, and a couple of commands for navigating notes more quickly.

## Features

-   **Typewriter Mode**: Keeps the current line at a fixed vertical position in the editor.
-   **Focus Mode**: Dims the text outside of the current line, sentence, paragraph, or section to help you concentrate.
-   **Quick Scrolling**: Adds commands to instantly move to the top or bottom of a note.
-   **Auto-Scroll for Daily Notes**: Automatically scrolls to the bottom of your daily note when you open it, so you can start writing straight away.
-   **Cursor Scrolling**: Lets you move the cursor line by line with the mouse wheel instead of scrolling the entire view.
-   **Hide Scrollbars**: An option to remove all scrollbars from the Obsidian interface for a cleaner look.

## How to Install

1.  Open **Settings** in Obsidian.
2.  Go to **Community plugins** and make sure that «Restricted mode» is turned **off**.
3.  Click **Browse** to open the community plugins store.
4.  Search for «Scroller».
5.  Click **Install**, and then **Enable** once it has downloaded.

## How to Use

Once installed, the plugin can be configured from its settings panel. Most features are disabled by default.

### Commands

Scroller adds two new commands to the command palette. You can assign hotkeys to them in Obsidian's settings.

-   **`Scroller: Scroll to top`**: Scrolls to the beginning of the current note.
-   **`Scroller: Scroll to bottom`**: Scrolls to the end of the current note.

### Settings

You can find the settings under `Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Scroller`. All features, such as typewriter mode, focus mode, and smooth scrolling, can be enabled and customised there.
